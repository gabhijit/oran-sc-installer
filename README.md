# Introduction

This is an installer for ORAN SC RIC Platforms and other ONAP components to get a basic working installation up and running. The goal of this project is not to be just a bunch of scripts that perform the actual work, but also explain what is happening under the hood, so that it's easier to debug issues one may face during the installation. Eventually the goal is to upstream this documentation to ORAN-SC.
